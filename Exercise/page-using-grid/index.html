            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
            needed sme structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and start did not disapoint. They
            were very hands on and I never had to wait long for assistancee. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could have. In
            fact, I've often refered to it during interviews as an example of my
            development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
            full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommend!"
